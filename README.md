# Health Monitoring System Using IoT  

## Overview  
The **Health Monitoring System** is an IoT-based solution designed to track and display vital health data in real time. It integrates sensors for monitoring parameters such as temperature, heart rate, and more, and presents the data via an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This system is particularly beneficial for remote patient monitoring and healthcare applications.  

---

## Features  
- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Collects and displays real-time health data from IoT sensors.  
- **User-friendly GUI**: A clean and interactive interface to visualize patient health statistics.  
- **Multi-parameter Support**: Measures various health metrics, such as temperature and heart rate.  
- **Scalable Design**: Can be adapted for multiple patients or advanced healthcare needs.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
To set up and run this project, you’ll need the following:  
- IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, pulse rate sensors).  
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi (or any other IoT platform).  
- A computer to run the GUI application.  
- **Software Requirements**:  
  - Python 3.x  (For Rpie)
  - Arduino IDE (if using Arduino for sensor connections).  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Abhip32/Health_Monitoring_System_IOT.git  
   cd Health_Monitoring_System_IOT  
   ```  

2. **Set Up Sensors**:  
   Connect the IoT sensors to your microcontroller or device following the schematics.  

3. **Add Credentials**:  
   Add necessary credntails for sending mail notifications and thingspeak 

4. **Run the GUI**:
   Run like normal HTML, CSS and JS based project
